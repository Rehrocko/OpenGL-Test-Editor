# SceneTest

Had some motivation to start learning C++, started ~2 weeks ago (I've had more experience coding as a whole)

Very fun so far but this is just a test, mostly finished as the code is a mess and I don't know what is happening anymore.

If you want to try it you can download the code and put it into Visual Studio. If you need help or have any suggestions 
(I'm sure there are thousands of things to suggest) feel free to do whatever you do on Github.

# Thanks for looking!
